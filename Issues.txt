Header scroll bar changes width when scrolling down
Can retrieve title of articles/responses for notifications, but can't attach them to the corresponding notification information.
	-- What if you use a multidimensional array?
	the first index would store the ID of the notification and the second would store the ACTED_ON portion

	notification[1]['Article of Amazing Article']
	notification[2]['Article of Amazing Article']
	notification[3]['Rules of Spelling']
	notification[4]['Rules of Spelling']

	Would need to rework ng-repeat to fit.
