User can't dislike/unbookmark articles

Display correct style if article is already liked/bookmarked

For each article call, get article info AND user data on that article (liked, bookmarked, shared).
If the user has liked/bookmarked an article, change the style accordingly.
If the user clicks an unliked/unbookmarked article, change style accordingly, push new ID to database.
If the user click a liked/bookmarked article, change style accordingly, remove ID from database.

What if likeArticle took in the article ID and just created the DB query? There's no need for scope to become involved whatsoever. 

ArticleNotification is now generating a 404 message despite correctly inputting data in database.
